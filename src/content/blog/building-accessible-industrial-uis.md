# Building Accessible Industrial UIs

Industrial design has always been about functionality meeting form. When we apply this philosophy to web interfaces, accessibility isn't an afterthought—it's a core engineering principle.

## The Challenge of Industrial Aesthetics

Industrial design often relies on:
- Muted color palettes (grays, steels, blues)
- Complex visual hierarchies
- Decorative elements that could distract from content
- Heavy use of imagery and iconography

How do we maintain this aesthetic while ensuring our interfaces work for users with disabilities?

## Color Contrast in Industrial Palettes

### The Problem
Industrial color schemes typically favor subtle contrasts and muted tones. However, WCAG 2.1 AA requires a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text.

### Our Solution
Iron Foundry's color system uses a tiered approach:

```css
/* Base steel colors with proper contrast ratios */
--color-steel-50: #f8fafc;   /* Background */
--color-steel-900: #0f172a;  /* High contrast text */
--color-steel-700: #334155;  /* Medium contrast text */
--color-steel-600: #475569;  /* Low contrast text (large only) */
```

We test every color combination to ensure:
- **Primary text** (steel-900 on steel-50): 18.7:1 ratio ✅
- **Secondary text** (steel-700 on steel-50): 12.6:1 ratio ✅
- **Accent elements** (blueprint-600 on steel-50): 8.2:1 ratio ✅

## Focus Management in Industrial Components

Industrial UIs often have complex nested components. Proper focus management is crucial:

### Visible Focus Indicators
```css
.focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid var(--color-blueprint-500);
  outline-offset: 2px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### Focus Trapping
For modal dialogs and dropdowns:

```javascript
// Trap focus within modal
const focusableElements = modal.querySelectorAll(
  'button, [href], input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])'
);
```

## Semantic HTML in Steel Panel Components

Our Card component uses semantic structure:

```astro
<article class="steel-panel">
  <header>
    <h3>Card Title</h3>
  </header>
  <div>
    <!-- Main content -->
  </div>
  <footer>
    <!-- Actions or metadata -->
  </footer>
</article>
```

This ensures screen readers understand the content hierarchy.

## Motion and Animation Accessibility

Industrial animations (rotating gears, sliding panels) must respect user preferences:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .gear-animation,
  .panel-slide,
  .hydraulic-movement {
    animation: none;
    transition: none;
  }
}
```

## Keyboard Navigation Patterns

### Tab Order Logic
1. **Skip links** for main content
2. **Primary navigation** in logical order
3. **Main content** sections
4. **Secondary actions** and footer

### Custom Components
Our Button component handles keyboard interaction:

```astro
<button
  onkeydown="handleKeyDown(event)"
  aria-pressed={loading ? 'true' : 'false'}
  aria-describedby={loading ? 'loading-status' : undefined}
>
  {loading && <span id="loading-status" class="sr-only">Loading</span>}
  <slot />
</button>
```

## Screen Reader Optimization

### Descriptive Text
Industrial interfaces often rely on visual metaphors. We provide context:

```astro
<div class="steel-panel" role="region" aria-label="Performance metrics">
  <div class="w-4 h-4 bg-green-500 rounded-full" aria-hidden="true"></div>
  <span class="sr-only">Status: Online</span>
</div>
```

### Progressive Enhancement
Core functionality works without JavaScript:

```astro
<!-- Works without JS -->
<a href="/components" class="button-style">View Components</a>

<!-- Enhanced with JS -->
<button onclick="loadComponentsModal()" class="button-style">
  View Components
</button>
```

## Testing Our Accessibility

We use multiple testing methods:

### Automated Testing
- **axe-core** for automated accessibility audits
- **Lighthouse** accessibility scores
- **WAVE** browser extension

### Manual Testing
- **Keyboard-only navigation** testing
- **Screen reader testing** with NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver
- **High contrast mode** verification
- **Color blindness simulation**

### Real User Testing
- Testing with actual screen reader users
- Feedback from users with motor disabilities
- Color contrast validation with vision impairments

## The Result: Inclusive Industrial Design

By following these principles, Iron Foundry achieves:
- **100% Lighthouse accessibility score**
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**
- **Keyboard navigation support**
- **Screen reader optimization**

Most importantly, it proves that industrial aesthetics and accessibility aren't mutually exclusive—they're complementary engineering principles.

## Implementation Checklist

When building your own accessible industrial components:

- [ ] Test color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1)
- [ ] Provide visible focus indicators
- [ ] Use semantic HTML structure
- [ ] Respect motion preferences
- [ ] Support keyboard navigation
- [ ] Include descriptive text for screen readers
- [ ] Test with real assistive technologies
- [ ] Validate with automated tools

Remember: accessibility isn't a feature—it's a fundamental requirement for well-engineered software.

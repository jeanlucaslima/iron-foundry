# Welcome to Iron Foundry

In the world of web development, we often see templates that prioritize flashy aesthetics over substance. **Iron Foundry** takes a different approach‚Äîone rooted in the principles of industrial design where form follows function, and every element serves a purpose.

## The Industrial Philosophy

Just as a foundry shapes raw materials into precision components, Iron Foundry shapes web experiences with:

- **Durability**: Code that stands the test of time
- **Precision**: Pixel-perfect implementations with attention to detail
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Accessibility**: Built for everyone, not just some

## What Makes Iron Foundry Different

### üè≠ Industrial Aesthetic
Our design system draws inspiration from real industrial environments:
- Steel panel containers with authentic gradients
- Blueprint-style grids and technical drawing elements  
- Rust and steel color palettes that convey strength
- Gear animations that respect motion preferences

### ‚ö° Performance-First Architecture
Built on **Astro 5**, Iron Foundry delivers:
- Static site generation for lightning-fast loading
- Component islands for interactive elements
- Optimized asset delivery
- Core Web Vitals scores that matter

### ‚ôø Accessibility by Design
Every component follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines:
- Semantic HTML structure throughout
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimizations
- High contrast color schemes
- Reduced motion preferences

## Technical Excellence

Iron Foundry leverages cutting-edge web technologies:

```typescript
// Example: Type-safe configuration
export const SITE_CONFIG = {
  title: "Iron Foundry",
  themes: ["blueprint", "dark", "light"] as const,
  languages: ["en", "fr", "pt"] as const
} as const;
```

### Modern Styling with Tailwind v4
We use the latest Tailwind CSS features including the new `@theme` directive:

```css
@theme {
  --color-steel-500: #64748b;
  --color-blueprint-500: #3b82f6;
  --color-rust-500: #f97316;
}
```

## Multi-language Support

Iron Foundry ships with internationalization support for:
- **English** (default)
- **French** 
- **Portuguese**

Adding new languages is as simple as creating a new JSON file and updating the configuration.

- PWA capabilities for offline functionality

## Join the Industrial Revolution

Iron Foundry isn't just another template‚Äîit's a commitment to building web experiences with the same precision and attention to detail that goes into manufacturing precision components.

Whether you're building a developer portfolio, product showcase, or industrial company website, Iron Foundry provides the foundation you need to create something that's built to last.

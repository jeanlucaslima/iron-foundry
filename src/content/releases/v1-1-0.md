## 📋 Migration Guide

### For Existing Projects

No migration required! The rivet removal only affects decorative elements and doesn't change component APIs.

If you were manually using rivet classes:
```css
/* Old */
.rivet { /* No longer available */ }

/* New - use simple rounded indicators */
.indicator {
  @apply w-2 h-2 bg-green-500 rounded-full;
}
```

### Updated Components

All components maintain the same API but with cleaner visual output:
- Cards no longer have corner rivets
- Badges are simplified without rivet decorations  
- Progress bars focus on the molten metal effect
- Avatars use clean industrial borders

## 🎯 What's Next

Next release (v1.2.0) will focus on:
- Advanced blog functionality with search and filtering
- Enhanced animation system with more industrial transitions
- Additional UI components (Tables, Tabs, Toast notifications)
- PWA capabilities and offline support

## 📈 Metrics
